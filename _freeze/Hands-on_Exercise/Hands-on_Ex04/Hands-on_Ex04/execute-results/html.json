If there is a clear pattern or ranking among groups, making insights easier to spot. When you want to efficiently visualize distributions without using separate plots. When Not to Use Ridgeline Plots:\n\nIf there are fewer than 5 groups, other distribution plots (e.g., boxplots) may be better. When groups lack a clear pattern, as overlapping can make the plot messy. If hiding some data due to overlap reduces clarity rather than improving visualization.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"gray\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, \n                   expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### **1.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis**\n",
