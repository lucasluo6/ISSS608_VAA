## üß© Node Types Description

Based on the data dictionary and actual values in the JSON file, we can classify the following node types:

| Node Type      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Person`       | Any individual contributor, including singers, lyricists, composers, etc.   |
| `MusicalGroup` | Groups formed by multiple individuals, e.g., bands or choirs                |
| `Song`         | Individual song tracks with attributes like release date, genre, etc.       |
| `Album`        | Grouped collections of songs, with their own release and popularity markers |
| `RecordLabel`  | Organizations involved in production, recording, or distribution            |

We can also check their frequency in the dataset:

```{r}
# Custom palette inspired by genre styles
genre_palette <- c(
  "#A566FF",  # Person (lavender)
  "#2ECC71",  # Song (green)
  "#1C1C1E",  # RecordLabel (black)
  "#FA7268",  # Album (salmon)
  "#34B1C4"   # MusicalGroup (aqua)
)

node_types <- node_types %>% 
  mutate(text_color = ifelse(n > 1000, "white", "black"),
         text_hjust = ifelse(n > 1000, 1.1, -0.1))

    plot.margin = margin(10, 60, 30, 10)
  )
```

These insights provide a foundation to interpret future patterns in artist collaboration, influence, and success prediction.

## üåç 2. Sailor Shift‚Äôs Ego Network Overview (Full Connected Subgraph)

### üìå Objective

This section extracts and visualizes the **full connected subgraph** centered on *Sailor Shift*, showcasing all directly and indirectly connected entities in the knowledge graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üå≠Ô∏è Step 1: Extract All Connected Nodes

```{r}
# Get Sailor Shift's node id
sailor_id <- nodes_tbl %>% 
  filter(name == "Sailor Shift") %>% 
  pull(id)

# Convert tidygraph to igraph for component extraction
ig <- as.igraph(g)

# Identify the connected component that includes Sailor Shift
component_id <- igraph::components(ig)$membership[which(V(ig)$id == sailor_id)]
connected_ids <- V(ig)[igraph::components(ig)$membership == component_id]$name
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üåç Step 2: Visualize Static Subgraph with Interactive 3-Hop Network

```{r}
# Convert to igraph and compute 3-hop neighborhood
ig <- as.igraph(g)
sailor_vid <- which(V(ig)$id == sailor_id)
neighbor_ids <- ego(ig, order = 2, nodes = sailor_vid, mode = "all")[[1]]

sub3_ids <- V(ig)[neighbor_ids]$id
sub3_nodes_tbl <- nodes_tbl %>% filter(id %in% sub3_ids)
sub3_edges_tbl <- edges_tbl %>% filter(source %in% sub3_ids & target %in% sub3_ids)

# Prepare visNetwork data
# Modify vis_nodes to make "Sailor Shift" larger and bold
vis_nodes <- sub3_nodes_tbl %>%
  mutate(size = ifelse(name == "Sailor Shift", 50, 20)) %>%  # üîç Control node size
  transmute(
    id = id,
    label = name,
    group = `Node Type`,
    title = paste0("<b>", name, "</b><br>Type: ", `Node Type`),
    value = size  # visNetwork uses 'value' to control node size
  )

# vis_edges remains unchanged
vis_edges <- sub3_edges_tbl %>%
  transmute(from = source, to = target, label = `Edge Type`, arrows = "to")

# Render Interactive Graph with highlighted Sailor Shift
visNetwork(vis_nodes, vis_edges, width = "100%", height = "700px") %>%
  visEdges(smooth = TRUE) %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = TRUE, degree = 2), nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 2025) %>%
  visLegend(useGroups = TRUE, main = "Node Type") %>%
  visPhysics(stabilization = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This full subgraph gives a comprehensive view of Sailor Shift's artistic ecosystem, while the interactive 3-hop version allows users to explore relationships with greater clarity and responsiveness.

üîç Insight: Sailor Shift‚Äôs Influence Ecosystem The Ego Network of Sailor Shift reveals a highly connected artistic ecosystem spanning songs, albums, musical groups, and record labels. Her position at the center of a dense subgraph highlights her role as a key figure in the Oceanus Folk community. The variety of edges (e.g., InterpolatesFrom, PerformerOf, MemberOf) suggests not only her creative versatility but also her multi-layered influence network‚Äîincluding direct artistic collaborations and indirect stylistic references.

Notably:

She interacts with all five node types (Person, Song, Album, MusicalGroup, RecordLabel),

Her connections include both creative influence (via stylistic or lyrical references) and professional affiliations (production, distribution, membership).

This network serves as a powerful visual entry point for investigating how and by whom Sailor Shift has been influenced, who she in turn has influenced, and what her broader role is within the Oceanus Folk genre.

üöÄ Moving Forward: Task-based Subgraph Exploration With this foundation, we will now delve deeper into three core analytical tasks, each focused on a unique aspect of Sailor Shift‚Äôs artistic identity and influence. Each task will be accompanied by an interactive or static visualization powered by the knowledge graph.

## ‚úÖ Task 1 ‚Äì Who Has Influenced Sailor Shift?

### üéØ Objective:

Use the knowledge graph to identify **who has influenced Sailor Shift over time**, by analyzing stylistic, lyrical, or sampling relationships represented in the graph. These insights will reveal patterns in her creative development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üîç Why This Approach?

Sailor Shift‚Äôs musical evolution is shaped by direct and indirect artistic influences. In a knowledge graph, influence is captured by specific edge types:

### üé® Style and Influence Relationships

| Edge Type            | Meaning                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `InStyleOf`          | A mimics the style of B          |
| `CoverOf`            | A is a cover version of B        |
| `InterpolatesFrom`   | A interpolates melody from B     |
| `LyricalReferenceTo` | A makes a lyrical reference to B |
| `DirectlySamples`    | A directly samples audio from B  |

These edge types describe different ways an artist or work may influence Sailor Shift. By filtering the graph for these edge types where **Sailor Shift is the target**, we construct a reliable picture of who influenced her and how.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By filtering the graph for these edge types targeting Sailor Shift, we can construct a reliable view of her artistic lineage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå Step 1: Extract Influencer Edges

```{r}
influence_types <- c("InStyleOf", "CoverOf", "InterpolatesFrom", "LyricalReferenceTo", "DirectlySamples")

# Get edges that influence her
influencer_edges <- graph_data$links %>%
  filter(`Edge Type` %in% influence_types, target == sailor_id) %>%
  left_join(nodes_tbl, by = c("source" = "id")) %>%
  rename(influencer_name = name, influencer_type = `Node Type`) %>%
  select(source, target, `Edge Type`, influencer_name, influencer_type)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå Step 2: Visualize Influencer Type Distribution

```{r}
influencer_edges %>%
  count(`Edge Type`, influencer_type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`Edge Type`, n), y = n, fill = influencer_type)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Types of Influences on Sailor Shift",
    subtitle = "By relationship and influencer type",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Helvetica Neue") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```

üîç Insight: Who Influenced Sailor Shift?

The bar chart reveals the distribution of influence types on Sailor Shift, broken down by the influencer's node type (`MusicalGroup` or `Person`). Key takeaways:

-   **MusicalGroups are dominant** in all influence categories:
    -   They account for **all** `InStyleOf` influences, suggesting that Sailor Shift's stylistic inspirations largely stem from band-level aesthetics.
    -   For `DirectlySamples`, `MusicalGroup` nodes are again the exclusive contributors, highlighting a tendency to sample from established group-based soundscapes.
-   **Persons contribute notably to lyrical and melodic references**:
    -   Half of the `LyricalReferenceTo` and `InterpolatesFrom` edges are from `Person` nodes. This suggests a more personal or individual-driven source of lyrical and melodic inspiration, possibly tied to solo artist storytelling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå Step 3: Visualize Knowledge Graph of Influencers

```{r}
# Extract relevant nodes
influencer_ids <- influencer_edges$source

influencer_nodes <- nodes_tbl %>%
  filter(id %in% influencer_ids | id == sailor_id) %>%
  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE)

influencer_links <- graph_data$links %>%
  filter(source %in% influencer_ids, target == sailor_id)

# Map to row indices for subgraph
id_map <- tibble(id = influencer_nodes$id, index = seq_len(nrow(influencer_nodes)))

influencer_links_mapped <- influencer_links %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = c("source" = "id")) %>%
  rename(from = index) %>%
  left_join(id_map, by = c("target" = "id")) %>%
  rename(to = index) %>%
  filter(!is.na(from), !is.na(to))

# Create subgraph
influencer_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = influencer_nodes, edges = influencer_links_mapped, directed = TRUE)

# Draw the graph
set.seed(2025)
ggraph(influencer_graph, layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(color = `Edge Type`),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm')),
    end_cap = circle(3, 'mm')
  ) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = `Node Type`), size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(
    aes(label = name),  # ‚úÖ Show all node names
    repel = TRUE,
    size = 4,
    fontface = ifelse(influencer_nodes$name == "Sailor Shift", "bold", "plain")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Who Influenced Sailor Shift?",
    subtitle = "All nodes labeled in subgraph"
  ) +
  theme_graph(base_family = "Helvetica Neue")

```

### üîç Step 3 Insight: Direct Artistic Influences on Sailor Shift

The static knowledge graph in Step 3 provides a clear snapshot of **who directly influenced Sailor Shift**, based on well-defined artistic relationships such as `DirectlySamples`, `InterpolatesFrom`, `InStyleOf`, and `LyricalReferenceTo`.

#### ‚ú® Key Observations:

-   **Diverse Influence Channels**: Sailor Shift‚Äôs inspirations are not confined to a single creative channel. She samples music (`DirectlySamples`), borrows stylistic cues (`InStyleOf`), lifts lyrical fragments (`LyricalReferenceTo`), and interpolates melodies (`InterpolatesFrom`).

-   **Balanced Influencer Types**: Influences come from both **individual artists** and **musical groups**, indicating that her artistry draws from both personal voices and collective aesthetics.

-   **Dense Inbound Edges**: The graph shows multiple inbound links converging on Sailor Shift, underscoring her role as a stylistic inheritor of a tightly connected creative network.

#### üß† Interpretation:

This direct influence map builds a foundation for understanding her creative identity. However, it only reflects surface-level lineage‚Äîi.e., **those explicitly linked to her** in the graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ‚è≠Ô∏è Why We Proceed to Step 4

While Step 3 gives us a high-fidelity view of Sailor Shift‚Äôs direct inspirations, it leaves several questions unanswered:

-   **Who are the individuals behind the musical groups?**
-   **Are there unseen intermediaries‚Äîlike songs or albums‚Äîthat serve as vehicles of influence?**
-   **What multi-hop chains of inspiration exist beyond what is immediately visible?**

To answer these, we transition to **Step 4**, where we:

-   Traverse **multi-layer influence chains** (not limited to 1-hop)
-   Expand **MusicalGroup** nodes into their individual **Person** members (via `MemberOf`)
-   Visualize **deep indirect relationships** that build Sailor Shift‚Äôs identity over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå Step 4: Show All Influence Types in Indirect Graph

```{r}
# Influence edge types
influence_types <- c("InStyleOf", "CoverOf", "InterpolatesFrom", "LyricalReferenceTo", "DirectlySamples")

# Expand full influence paths recursively (e.g. up to 5 hops)
max_depth <- 5
influence_paths <- tibble()
current_targets <- sailor_id

for (i in 1:max_depth) {
  next_edges <- edges_tbl %>% filter(`Edge Type` %in% influence_types, target %in% current_targets)
  if (nrow(next_edges) == 0) break
  next_edges <- next_edges %>% mutate(depth = paste0(i, "-hop"))
  influence_paths <- bind_rows(influence_paths, next_edges)
  current_targets <- unique(next_edges$source)
}

# Identify Musical Groups and expand their members
musical_group_ids <- nodes_tbl %>% filter(`Node Type` == "MusicalGroup") %>% pull(id)
member_edges <- edges_tbl %>% filter(`Edge Type` == "MemberOf", target %in% musical_group_ids)

# If any musical group is in influence path, bring in members
group_ids_in_path <- influence_paths %>% filter(source %in% musical_group_ids) %>% pull(source)
extra_members <- member_edges %>% filter(target %in% group_ids_in_path)

# Combine all edges
full_edges <- bind_rows(
  influence_paths %>% mutate(hop = depth),
  extra_members %>% mutate(hop = "GroupMember")
)

# Related node ids
related_ids <- unique(c(full_edges$source, full_edges$target, sailor_id))
vis_nodes <- nodes_tbl %>% filter(id %in% related_ids) %>%
  mutate(
    label = name,
    group = `Node Type`,
    value = ifelse(name == "Sailor Shift", 50, 20),
    title = paste0("<b>", name, "</b><br>Type: ", `Node Type`)
  ) %>%
  select(id, label, group, value, title)

vis_edges <- full_edges %>%
  mutate(
    arrows = "to",
    label = `Edge Type`,
    color = case_when(
      `Edge Type` == "DirectlySamples" ~ "#FF6B6B",
      `Edge Type` == "InterpolatesFrom" ~ "#4D96FF",
      `Edge Type` == "CoverOf" ~ "#FFD93D",
      `Edge Type` == "InStyleOf" ~ "#6BCB77",
      `Edge Type` == "LyricalReferenceTo" ~ "#C780FA",
      `Edge Type` == "MemberOf" ~ "#BDBDBD",
      TRUE ~ "#999999"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(from = source, to = target, arrows, label, color)

visNetwork(vis_nodes, vis_edges, width = "100%", height = "800px") %>%
  visEdges(smooth = TRUE) %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE, nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 2025) %>%
  visLegend(useGroups = TRUE, main = "Node Type") %>%
  visPhysics(stabilization = TRUE)
```

#### üîç Step 4 Insight: Full Influence Graph with Group Member Expansion

The interactive graph in Step 4 reveals the **deep influence structure** surrounding Sailor Shift, integrating both direct and indirect artistic relationships and **group-to-individual decompositions**.

#### üéØ Key Observations:

-   **Musical Groups as Gateways**: Many key influences (e.g., *The Phantom Operators*, *Cassette Future*) are MusicalGroups. However, their true impact on Sailor Shift is clarified only after unfolding their members. This highlights the importance of surfacing latent human contributors.

-   **Individuals Behind the Sound**:

    -   *Juno Ray*, *Savannah Teal*, *Zara Quinn*, and others appear as hidden but crucial figures influencing Sailor Shift indirectly through their band affiliations.
    -   These artists are connected through `MemberOf` ‚Üí `MusicalGroup` ‚Üí `InfluenceType` paths, showing that influence isn't always linear or direct.

-   **Multi-Relation Influence**: Relationships such as `InterpolatesFrom`, `InStyleOf`, and `LyricalReferenceTo` show that Sailor Shift does not just imitate style‚Äîshe blends lyrical and musical fragments from diverse sources.

-   **Dense Centrality**: Sailor Shift sits at the hub of a **diverse, multi-layered network**, receiving creative input from solo artists, collective groups, and intermediary compositions (albums/songs).

#### üß† Interpretation:

This graph confirms that Sailor Shift is not only influenced by prominent entities but is also indirectly shaped by **dozens of individuals**, whose contributions are embedded within groups. Her artistic identity emerges from a blend of:

-   Stylized group traditions
-   Personal lyrical echoes
-   Collaborative musical lineages

It also suggests that to understand her evolution, one must look beyond direct citations and recognize the **ecosystem of creators** behind the visible front.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå Step 5: Expand Influence Path ‚Äì Including Songs/Albums (‚â§ 5 Hops)

```{r}
# Influence edge types
